# Chat Animations & Audio Notifications Implementation

## Overview
Added smooth animations and audio notifications to the chat interface for an enhanced user experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ðŸŽ¬ Message Animations
- **Slide-in animations** for new messages (both incoming and outgoing)
- **Direction-aware animations**: 
  - Customer messages slide in from the **left**
  - Agent/bot messages slide in from the **right**
- **Smooth bounce effect** using cubic-bezier easing
- **Auto-removal** of animation class after 500ms to prevent re-triggering

### 2. ðŸ”” Audio Notifications
- **Notification sound** plays when receiving messages from customers
- **Volume**: Set to 50% by default for comfort
- **Smart triggering**: Only plays for incoming customer messages, not for messages you send
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles cases where audio playback is blocked by browser
- **Audio file**: Uses `/public/notification.wav`

### 3. ðŸŽ¨ Animation Details
**CSS Keyframes:**
```css
@keyframes slide-in-left {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(-20px) scale(0.95);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0) scale(1);
  }
}

@keyframes slide-in-right {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(20px) scale(0.95);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0) scale(1);
  }
}
```

**Animation Properties:**
- Duration: 400ms
- Easing: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) - creates a pleasant bounce effect
- Effects: Slide + Fade + Scale for smooth appearance

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files

#### 1. `components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx`
- Added `audioRef` for audio element management
- Added `previousMessageCountRef` for tracking message changes
- Created `playNotificationSound()` function
- Audio initialization on component mount
- Integrated sound playback with WebSocket message subscription
- Only plays sound for `is_from_customer: true` messages

#### 2. `components/chat/MessageThread.tsx`
- Added `animatingMessageIds` state to track which messages are animating
- Added `previousMessageIdsRef` to detect new messages
- Created effect to detect new messages and trigger animations
- Applied animation classes conditionally based on message direction
- Reset animation state when conversation changes

#### 3. `app/globals.css`
- Added CSS keyframe definitions for slide-in animations
- Added animation utility classes

## User Experience

### When a new message arrives:
1. âœ¨ Message **slides in** with a smooth bounce effect
2. ðŸ”” **Notification sound** plays (customer messages only)
3. ðŸ“œ Chat **auto-scrolls** to the new message
4. ðŸŽ¯ **Visual feedback** that clearly shows the message direction

### When you send a message:
1. âœ¨ Message **slides in** from the right
2. ðŸ”‡ **No sound** (to avoid notification fatigue)
3. ðŸ“œ Chat **auto-scrolls** to your message
4. âš¡ **Instant feedback** with smooth animation

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with support for:
  - CSS animations
  - Web Audio API
  - ES6+ JavaScript features
- Graceful degradation for older browsers (messages still appear, just without animation)

## Performance Considerations
- Animations are hardware-accelerated (transform & opacity)
- Audio element is reused (not recreated for each message)
- Animation classes are removed after completion to prevent memory leaks
- Efficient message change detection using Sets

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add volume control settings
- Add option to disable animations
- Add option to disable sound notifications
- Add different sounds for different message types
- Add visual notification badge when tab is not focused
- Add desktop notifications with Notification API

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Open the chat interface
2. Wait for a customer to send a message
3. Observe: Slide-in animation from left + notification sound
4. Send a message yourself
5. Observe: Slide-in animation from right (no sound)

## Notes
- The notification sound file should be placed at `/public/notification.wav`
- Volume is set to 0.5 (50%) to avoid being too loud
- Animations are disabled on conversation changes to prevent overwhelming the UI
- Sound playback failures are logged to console but don't affect functionality
