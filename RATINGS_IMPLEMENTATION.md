# Ratings Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the customer ratings feature in the Sufrah Dashboard, based on the ratings API documentation.

## Implementation Date

October 20, 2025

## What Was Implemented

### 1. API Endpoints (Backend)

Created three API endpoints under `/app/api/db/ratings/`:

#### a. List Ratings - `GET /api/db/ratings`
- **Location**: `/app/api/db/ratings/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Pagination support (limit, offset)
  - Filter by rating value (minRating, maxRating)
  - Returns ratings with customer information
  - Cookie-based authentication with restaurant scoping

#### b. Rating Statistics - `GET /api/db/ratings/stats`
- **Location**: `/app/api/db/ratings/stats/route.ts`
- **Returns**:
  - Total number of ratings
  - Average rating (rounded to 2 decimals)
  - Distribution across 1-5 stars

#### c. Single Rating Detail - `GET /api/db/ratings/[id]`
- **Location**: `/app/api/db/ratings/[id]/route.ts`
- **Returns**:
  - Complete rating information
  - Order items with quantities and prices
  - Customer information
  - Timeline (order created, rating asked, rating submitted)

### 2. Ratings Page (Frontend)

Created a comprehensive ratings page at `/app/ratings/page.tsx`:

#### Key Features:

**A. Summary Dashboard**
- 4 stat cards displaying:
  - Total Ratings count
  - Average Rating with stars
  - Positive Ratings percentage (4-5 stars)
  - Low Ratings count (1-3 stars)

**B. Rating Distribution Chart**
- Visual bar chart showing distribution across 1-5 stars
- Percentage and count for each rating level
- Color-coded with yellow theme

**C. Ratings Table**
- Searchable by customer name, phone, or comment
- Filterable by rating value (1-5 stars)
- Columns:
  - Customer (name + masked phone)
  - Rating (visual stars + numeric)
  - Comment excerpt
  - Order type
  - Total amount
  - Date and time
  - View details action

**D. Rating Detail Modal**
- Triggered by clicking "View Details" on any rating
- Displays:
  - Large star rating visualization
  - Full customer comment
  - Customer information (name, phone, order type, payment method, branch)
  - Order timeline
  - Complete list of order items with quantities and prices
  - Total amount

**E. UI Components**
- Custom `StarRating` component with 3 sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Loading states for async operations
- Empty state messages

### 3. Navigation Update

**File**: `/components/dashboard-layout.tsx`

- Added "Ratings" navigation item with Star icon
- Positioned between "Orders" and "Catalog" for logical flow
- Highlighted when active

### 4. Supporting Files

- **Loading State**: `/app/ratings/loading.tsx` - Shows spinner while page loads

## Database Schema Used

The implementation uses existing fields from the `Order` model in Prisma:

```prisma
model Order {
  rating          Int?         @map("rating")           // 1-5 stars
  ratingComment   String?      @map("rating_comment")   // Optional comment
  ratedAt         DateTime?    @map("rated_at")         // Submission timestamp
  ratingAskedAt   DateTime?    @map("rating_asked_at")  // Request timestamp
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Privacy Considerations

The implementation includes privacy-focused features:

1. **Phone Number Masking**: Customer phone numbers are displayed as `***1234` (only last 4 digits shown)
2. **Restaurant Scoping**: All queries are scoped to the authenticated user's restaurant
3. **Cookie Authentication**: Uses existing cookie-based auth system

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Notifications**: Sonner toast library

## API Response Formats

### List Ratings Response
```json
[
  {
    "id": "cm123abc456",
    "orderReference": "12345",
    "rating": 5,
    "ratingComment": "Excellent service!",
    "ratedAt": "2025-10-20T14:30:00.000Z",
    "customerName": "John Doe",
    "customerPhone": "966501234567",
    "totalCents": 8500,
    "currency": "SAR",
    // ... other fields
  }
]
```

### Statistics Response
```json
{
  "totalRatings": 150,
  "averageRating": 4.35,
  "distribution": {
    "1": 5,
    "2": 8,
    "3": 22,
    "4": 45,
    "5": 70
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. User clicks "Ratings" in sidebar navigation
2. Page loads with summary stats at the top
3. Distribution chart shows visual breakdown
4. Recent ratings table displays with search/filter options
5. User can search by customer name, phone, or comment
6. User can filter by specific star rating
7. Clicking "View Details" (eye icon) opens detailed modal
8. Modal shows complete order and rating information
9. User can close modal to return to main list

## Performance Considerations

- **Pagination**: API supports limit/offset for large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Rating details only fetched when modal is opened
- **Caching**: Uses `cache: "no-store"` to ensure fresh data
- **Client-Side Filtering**: Search and filter happen in browser for instant response

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential features for future development:

1. **Export Functionality**: CSV/Excel export of ratings data
2. **Date Range Filtering**: Filter ratings by date range
3. **Response Templates**: Quick responses to low ratings
4. **Email Notifications**: Alert on low ratings
5. **Trend Analysis**: Rating trends over time
6. **Branch Comparison**: Compare ratings across multiple branches
7. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live rating updates

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Testing**: Test all three endpoints with various filters
2. **UI Testing**: Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet/desktop
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - No ratings yet (empty state)
   - Very long comments (truncation)
   - Missing customer information
   - Large number of order items
   - Different currencies

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/app/api/db/ratings/route.ts`
- `/app/api/db/ratings/stats/route.ts`
- `/app/api/db/ratings/[id]/route.ts`
- `/app/ratings/page.tsx`
- `/app/ratings/loading.tsx`
- `/RATINGS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `/components/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Added Ratings navigation item

## Dependencies

All required dependencies were already present in the project:
- `@prisma/client`
- `lucide-react`
- `sonner`
- `next`
- `react`
- UI components from shadcn/ui

## Notes

- No database migrations were required (rating fields already exist in schema)
- The implementation is production-ready
- All code follows the existing patterns in the codebase
- TypeScript types are properly defined
- Error handling is implemented for all API calls
- Loading states provide good UX during data fetching

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check the API endpoints are accessible
2. Verify database contains orders with ratings
3. Ensure user authentication is working
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
5. Review server logs for API errors
